//Interface is used for 100% abstractness
//we can develop two types of members 1)Constants 2)Abstract

//Attribute which is a static and final is a constant
//by default interface attribute are static and final
//by default interface method is abstract
//every member of the interface is a public by default(cannot be declared as private or protected)
//interface is not a public by default
