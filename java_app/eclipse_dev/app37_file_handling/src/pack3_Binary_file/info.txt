-FileInputStream and FileOutputStream are similar to FileReader and FileWriter as they are low level api's which perform read and write operations byte by byte,
 unlike the latter that perform read and write  character by character.


-BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream api's built on top of FileInputStream and FileOutputStream, only they perform read and write operations,
 on a bucket(the size is variable) of bytes, which more efficient and faster.
 
FileInputStream : 
-opens a input stream for byte by byte reading

methods :
0. FileInputStream(File file) :
   FileInputStream(String name) :
1. long length() : returns the length of the file.


FileOutputStream : 
-opens a output stream for byte by byte writing

methods : 
0. FileOutputStream(File file) :
   FileOutputStream(String name) :
   
   
BufferedInputStream :
-opens a new Input stream to read data from the specifying underlying Input stream.

methods :
0. BufferedInputStream(InputStream in) :
   BufferedInputStream(InputStream in, int size) :


BufferedOutputStream :
-opens a new Output stream to write data to the specifying underlying output stream.

methods :
0. BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out) :
   BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size) :
