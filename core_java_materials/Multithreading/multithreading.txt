Multithreading:
---------------

process/task: A process/task is a program which is under execution by the microcomputer.

single process/single task: microprocessor will execute only one task at a time

Multi process/multi task: microprocessor will execute more than one task at a time.

Thread:
-------
-Line of execution

Two types of Threads:
    -Single Thread:
    ---------------
        -Only one line of execution (sequential execution)
    -Mutiple Thread:
    ----------------
        -Mutiple lines of execution(parallel Execution) so that microprocessor time can be effectively utilized.
    
Multithreading:

 ->MultiThreading is the process of creating mutiple threads in order to execute independent subtasks present in 
   the  java program parallel without wasting CPU time.
 ->Adavatage of multi threading is whenever one subtask one subtask wasting time, the thread scheduler can schedule 
   another sub task for execution without wasting CPU time.
 ->Thread scheduler is a software which is responsible for:
    -Allocation of resources for thread
    -Execution of thread
    -once ites execution completed de-allocation of resources
 ->By default, for all the java programs, JVM will create one thread called as "main" thread.
 ->Thrad scheduler will always allow main thread to begin execution, Only then, it will schedule user-defined
   threads.
 ->Every thread will be having
    -Name of the thread
    -Priority of the thread
