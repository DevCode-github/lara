Immuatable - String class
Mutable - StringBuilder, StringBuffer

Comparison of strings:
----------------------
-> if we use == operator for comparing strings, the references of the strings would be compared.
-> if we use equals() method in string class, the contents of the strings would be compared
-> if we use equals() method in StringBuffer class, then references will compared.

Memory allocation of string objects:
-----------------------------------
-> String object would be created on Heap area.
-> Only for string class objects JVM has allocated a seperate reserved space on Heap called String Constant pool.
-> if we create string without using new keyword, then one string object will be created on SCP area 
-> if we create String object using new keyword, then 2 string objects will be created. Main copy will be created 
   on the Heap area and the reference varicalbewould start pointing to the String object. 
   Also JVM would create extra copy of the same string on the scp area for future purposes for thier extra copy, 
   user defined varibale will not point.
-> Duplicates are not permmited in SCP area.
-> Duplicates are permmited in the heap area.


Mutable Strings:
----------------
-> Mutable string mean its mofifiable
-> Java has provided classes to manage mutable strings
   ->StringBuffer
   ->StringBuilder
-> String cannot be converted to StringBuffer and StringBuilder
-> In StringBuffer equals method in not overrided
-> StringBuffer new size = oldsize*2 + 2
