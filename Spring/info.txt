what is application?
User level:
    -Standalone application - if we install we can use it, if you have it you can use it.
    -web application - Internet(to connect to server) and server and user --web application.
Enterprise level:
    -enterprise application - 

java program - 

web application :
    we need server - deploy in server - port number - ip-localhost

Framework:
    -Framework is the body or platfrom of predefined codes, which are used to develop application.
    -some one will give all raw material at once - ready to use

Spring:
    light weight
    opensource
    Framework of Frameworks

Modules:
IOC(Inversion of control)
AOP
DAO
ORM
WEB/web MVC

IOC: (helps in creating objects(Dependency) which are required for starting the project)
    class person{
        Address address;
        String name;
        int age;
        Person(Address address){
            this.address = address;
        }
    }
    class Address{
        String streetName;
        String doorNo;
        String state;
        String pincode;
    }
its called DI(Dependency Injection)
person -- address --reference for person


IOC makes code loosely coupled, i.e no need to modify the code if our logic move to new environment.

predefined template:
template: a form mold or pattern used as a guide to make something

light wieght:
    spring framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface
    ready to use
    light wieght  - data transfomration is easy using POJO (setter and getter methods)
fast development
modules for every need of application
